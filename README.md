# Forensic-Accounting-Cybercrime-Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio!
I have a strong passion about uncovering financial misconduct, exposing scams, and helping victims of fraud and corruption, and even the victims of fraud and corruption who went on to harm themselves or further. Through a combination of forensic accounting techniques, data analysis, cybersecurity practices, and investigative psychology and criminology, I aim to shine a light on hidden financial irregularities and contribute to a time where people's grandma's aren't vulnerable to random people stealing their bank access and their pensions
This repository reflects my journey, in both an academic and practical way as I build the skills and tools necessary to investigate fraud, cybercrime, and unethical behavior. As I progress, I will be expanding this portfolio with projects that showcase my learning, insights, and investigations.
My Mission & 4 Core Values:
Integrity First: as a student currently doing forensic psychology and criminology, Upholding ethical principles in all analyses and investigations is paramount.
Transparency: Documenting findings in a clear, reproducible manner.
Empathy: Understanding the real-world impact of fraud on individuals and organizations.
(Curiosity &) Evidence: Investigating anomalies thoroughly, guided by data and behavioral insights.
My goal is to combine data-driven investigation with human insight, helping organizations and individuals detect, understand, and prevent financial misconduct as much as I can, where I can, to those most vulnerable
